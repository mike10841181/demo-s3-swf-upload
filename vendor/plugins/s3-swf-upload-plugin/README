Usage
=======

1. $ script/generate s3_swf_upload

2. Configure your amazon parameters.  Either set these through the
   following environment variables:

        AMAZON_S3_SWF_UPLOAD_BUCKET => my_public_bucket
        AMAZON_ACCESS_KEY_ID        => secret
        AMAZON_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY    => very secret
        AMAZON_S3_SWF_UPLOAD_ACL    => public-read
  
   or hardcode them in     config/amazon_s3.yml

    The acl will default to private.
   
3. Upload a crossdomain.xml in your bucket and make it public-read.

   You can find what you need in generators/s3-swf-upload/templates in
   the plugin!

4. init s3_swf object:

  <%= s3_swf_upload_tag %>

5. When you click upload, your file will be upload to http://bucket.s3.amazonasw.com/ by default.

   IE the default prefix is '' (no prefix)

6. if you want to customise its behavior, here's a more complex example:

  <%= s3_swf_upload_tag(:width => 310, 
        :height => 40, 
        :success => 'alert("success");',
        :failed => 'alert("failed");',
        :selected => 'alert("selected");',
        :prefix => 'prefix_in_bucket',
        :upload => 'Press Here To Activate Upload') 
  %>

  In this case, files will be uploaded to http://bucket.s3.amazonasw.com/prefix_in_bucket/filename
